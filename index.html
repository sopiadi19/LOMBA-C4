                    Black tea has a myriad of health benefits. The flavor of black tea is stronger than green tea. Black tea is derived from Camellia Sinesis tea leaves. Its color is more intense due to the oxidation process which results in a higher caffeine content, which is about 40 mg per cup.

                    Oolong tea is similar to black tea. The fermentation process is very short, which gives this tea a strong flavor. Oolong tea comes from the leaves of the camellia sinensis plant. In China, oolong tea is known as wulong tea and has been consumed for centuries. Like black tea, oolong tea is produced through a process of oxidation. Oolong leaves wither after being harvested and go through a short-term drying process.

                    Dandelion tea made from dandelion roots has the same energy-boosting and concentration-boosting benefits as coffee. In addition, dandelion root tea has a flavor that is not much different from coffee. It helps to maintain digestive health, strengthen immunity, improve bone health, and reduce the risk of liver disease. There is a lot of evidence that dandelion root tea can cure liver disease.

                    Chrysanthemum tea is a type of flower tea from China that is often consumed today. Unlike regular tea, chrysanthemum tea does not contain caffeine as it is not derived from Camellia sinensis tea leaves. Chrysanthemum tea is commonly used to reduce fever and early cold symptoms.
